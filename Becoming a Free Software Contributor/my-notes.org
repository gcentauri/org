I'm Grant Shangreaux, a software engineer at Cardflight.

Today, I want to tell you my story about becoming a free software contributor. I'll
talk about the hurdles of getting to that first pull request and some of the other
ways you can contribute besides code. I hope you'll come away from this talk inspired
to go make your first contribution, or if you're already doing it, to be energized 
in your efforts!

There are many reasons to participate with the free software communtity. Personally,
you can learn a lot from other developers and users, expand your knowledge of programming
patterns, testing, project management, and collaboration with others. You can build
your resume by making trackable public contributions, whether it is code or answers on
Stack Overflow. Maybe you're a rockstar programmer doing it for eternal glory. But in
my opinion, the most compelling reason is to work for something good. I'd like to share
how the philosophy of free software allowed me to go from a user to professional programmer
and why I want to give back.

I've been a free software enthusiast since I first booted GNU/Linux nearly 15 years ago. 
I didn't have a laptop, and was trying to learn how to play the game go. Some online
resource pointed me to a bootable disc image I could burn on a CD and turn any machine
into my own personal go studying workstation. 

I was astonished. As a broke, cynical, college drop-out this experience of freedom
excited me. Not just that it didn't cost anything, I could suddenly turn some random
windows machine on campus into something entirely different, an operating system tuned 
to a niche purpose, packed with free, shareable information, created by someone on the
internet. This led me to learn about the Free Software Foundation, GNU/Linux, and Emacs.

So what is Free Software? (quote) 

That commitment to learn and share what is learned with others had a direct impact 
on my ability to become a programmer. There's a more specific definiton of free software
but it can get political, so I want to boil it down to this: Be a Good Neighbor.
Software impacts an ever increasing scope of our lives these days, and a lot of it
is not visible to users. Free software treats programmers and users as equals.

If you were here last month, the CTO of CardFlight Peter Wagener, gave a talk on
the economic reasons for companies to support free software projects. I was very
excited when he created CardFlight's OSS contribution program,  Even though I
had participated in online free software communities, it wasn't until 10 months
ago that I made my first pull request to a project on GitHub.
