** What is Free Software?
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Free software is simply software that respects our freedom -
    our freedom to learn and understand the software we are using. 
    
    Using free software lets you join a global community of people 
    who assert our rights to learn and to share what we learn with others.
    #+END_QUOTE  

    - Freedom 0 : I can /run/ the program how I choose.
    - Freedom 1 : I can study the source code of the program.
    - Freedom 2 : I am free to help my neighbor and distribute the program.
    - Freedom 3 : I am free to contribute to my community and share modified copies


** Freedom 0 - My first GNU/Linux Experience

* Ways You Can Participate
** Contributions
*** Documentation

    - Often needs more help than code

    - You can do it while you're learning something new

    - Non-official docs like blog posts and tutorials can really help a project

    - Very easy to get approved
*** Issue Triage
    - It is hard for maintainers to keep up [2000+ issues on Spacemacs]
    - Identify non-issues, ask the poster to close it
    - Labeling, categorizing, notifying
    - Reproducing the issue is helpful
*** Code
    - Don't put extra barriers in the way
    - Software you use you already have familiarity with
    - Pay attention to the community
    - Small incremental changes do add up
** Connections
*** Help Your Neighbors - Freedom 2
   - Software impacts an ever increasing scope of our lives. 
   - There will always be something you know that could help someone else
   - Software is knowledge
   - Software is communication

                          [[file:Help%20Your%20Neighbors/27655336_10155425407407169_6445338402893105737_n_2019-03-20_20-05-40.jpeg]]

*** Share the Knowledge
*** Manage and Maintain

* Takeaways
  - Free Software respects users and lets us learn and share what we learn
  - Community participation counts
  - You don't have to be a rockstar
  - Consistently spending time on one project adds up
  - Easy ways to make your first code contribution
