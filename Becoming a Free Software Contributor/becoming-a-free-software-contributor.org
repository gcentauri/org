   - Even so, my first PR wasn't until 10 months ago!

* How Free Software Changed my Life
** What is Free Software?
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Free software is simply software that respects our freedom -
    our freedom to learn and understand the software we are using. 
    
    Using free software lets you join a global community of people 
    who assert our rights to learn and to share what we learn with others.
    #+END_QUOTE  

    - Freedom 0 : I can run the program how I wish, for any purpose.
    - Freedom 1 : I can study and change the source code of the program.
    - Freedom 2 : I am free to help my neighbor and distribute the program.
    - Freedom 3 : I am free to contribute to my community and share modified programs.

** Freedom 0 : Running programs how I wish
*** My first GNU/Linux

*** Linux Everywhere!

** Freedom 1 : Studying and Changing Code
*** I Owe my Job to Emacs
                                 [[file:I%20Owe%20My%20Living%20to%20Emacs/768px-EmacsIcon.svg_2019-03-19_23-35-32.png]]

*** Emacs provides an end-user programming environment
    (set-cursor-color "orange")
    (set-cursor-color "purple")
    (spacemacs/cycle-spacemacs-theme)
    (tetris)

*** REPLs and Recursion - learning how to lisp  
    - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
    - How to Design Programs taught me how to teach

* Ways You Can Participate
** Freedom 2 : Helping Your Neighbor
   - Software impacts an ever increasing scope of our lives. 
   - Simply helping others successfully use free software counts

                                   [[file:Help%20Your%20Neighbors/27655336_10155425407407169_6445338402893105737_n_2019-03-20_20-05-40.jpeg]]
*** Share the Knowledge
   - There will always be something you know that could help someone else
   - Chat rooms, forums, mailing lists, Stack Exchanges
   

*** Manage and Maintain
** Freedom 3 : Contributing to Your Community
*** Documentation

    - Often needs more help than code [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/12044]]
    - You can do it while you're learning something new
    - Non-official docs like blog posts and tutorials can really help a project
    - Very easy to get approved

*** Issue Triage
    - It is hard for maintainers to keep up [2000+ issues on Spacemacs]
    - Identify non-issues, ask the poster to close it
    - Labeling, categorizing, notifying
    - Reproducing the issue is helpful
    - Sometimes it is coordinating with project dependencies
      https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/12008


*** Code
    - Don't put extra barriers in the way
    - Software you use you already have familiarity with
    - Pay attention to the community
    - Small incremental changes do add up

* Takeaways
  - Free Software respects users and lets us learn and share what we learn
  - Community participation counts
  - You don't have to be a rockstar
  - Consistently spending time on one project adds up
  - Easy ways to make your first code contribution
