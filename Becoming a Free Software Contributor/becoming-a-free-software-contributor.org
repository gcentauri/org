* Why Free Software?

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Free software is simply software that respects our freedom -
    our freedom to learn and understand the software we are using. 
    
    Using free software lets you join a global community of people 
    who assert our rights to learn and to share what we learn with others.

** Be a Good Neighbor 
   - Software impacts an ever increasing scope of our lives. 
   - There will always be something you know that could help someone else
   - Software is knowledge
   - Software is communication
