** MA Nazca - January 2018 - Jedinja's "NewCornerSuperRumble"
*** TODO Prelude
**** Pretender
  I have decided to go with an awake Earth Snake with level 6 earth magic.
  While I really wanted to take a dormant "rainbow" to fill out magic paths and
  provide minor blesses to my many sacred mages, I just had too much trouble 
  expanding with Nazca's troops.  I could carve out a decent little stronghold,
  but against the AI, I ended up starting to run low on gold and needing to expand
  more.  I started one war and then quickly was attacked by two other neighbors
  that ended my game.

  [[./Zuzu.png]]

  The [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]]6 Earth Snake is one of the easiest pretenders to use for expansion.  Having
  earth 6 gives extra protection (a side benefit of earth magic paths) and reinvigoration
  to the all sacred troops (great for mages and armored troops like Nazca's!).  This
  snake should be able to scare off indie troops on its own (it has Fear too!) and allow
  for a much quicker expansion in the first year.  Nazca needs lots of gold to support
  the mummified elders, and taking territory will be the best way to ensure that.

  This pretender will really play its biggest role in that first year, but thankfully
  it is cheap enough that it can provide decent scales to boost our gold and magic 
  ability.  I took Growth, Luck, and Magic 3 to accomplish that.  I hear Luck + Magic 
  synergize well with the events that will occur.  A little Turmoil won't hurt, and will
  increase the amount events slightly.  Sloth 2 because none of my troops require many
  resources (we'll talk about them next), and Cold 1 is default for Nazca.  Perhaps I
  should have taken even more Cold, one of my opponents is Abysia.  The reason I didn't
  was simply that there wasn't anything great to spend the points on.  
**** Units
  Our troops are mostly weak, our strength will come from the mobility of flying,
  and our mages.  We have a variety of weapons to deal with the troop types of our
  enemies.  Spears and lances against heavy armor (or maces if they lack helmets!)
  swords, axes and missles against chaff.  I suppose our maces could help against
  undead nations as well.  We also have decent archers that can back up a skeleton
  army or have flaming arrows, etc etc.  We will have to be quick and smart.  Harrassing
  the enemy and trying to force a battle on our own terms.
**** Research Plan
  Nazca's mages are quite powerful.  Coyas will be able to wear Earth Boots and reliably
  cast E4 spells with gems, and potentially without on the chance I get an E3 Coya.
  Incas are F2A2H3 and can potentially assist chaff with morale spells, archers with
  Flaming Arrows and Wind Guide, or just Evoke away and blast folks with fireballs 
  and lightning bolts.  Coyas can also summon skelespam.  If I find indie astral mages,
  then I will probably try to invest in Coya magic and try some communions as well.

  This will be a short game I'm guessing, so I should aim for spells that will be
  powerful in the midgame.

***** Earthquake - Evocation 5
  Not many of our rivals have flying units.  I think with the game settings I may be
  able to aim for using this spell to create a decisive situation allowing throne 
  captures to win.  What else will I get from Evocation?  Fireballs and lightning for
  my mages, perhaps 

***** Flaming Arrows - Enchantment 4
  Depending on our neighbors, this could be a good target.  Skeletons are also in this
  tree so we should do some good scouting to see if Enchantment is a good school.

**** Rival Pretender Nations
***** Abysia
***** Pangaea
***** Vanarus
***** Bandar Log
***** Pythium
***** Vanheim
*** Turn 1 - Spring - Fate Against Me
[[./fateful-first-move.png]]

Zuzu the Earth Serpent is boldy moving out into the neighboring province under our
dominion's control.  Generally, this is a good thing because it means the pretender
will have more hit points.  Ideally, Zuzu will scare away the indies without getting
hurt, and I will get a lead in the expansion game.  Afterall, I built my pretender
specifically for this purpose.

*** Turns 2-7 - Disaster and Despair
Unfortunately, in this instance, the blind rush into a province ended up being 
a major failure due to a large group of heavy cavalry.  I watched as Zuzu futiley
threw some flying shards at the heavily armed troops which shrugged it off.  They
had a priest encouraging them.  There was about 30 of them rather than 10-15 as
is usually seen.  Everything was wrong.  Zuzu held her ground for a while, but
eventually it seems like the fatigue must have hit a point that allowed several
big hits to land in a single turn.  Zuzu took perhaps 50-60 points of damage all
at once and began to flee.  The morale of the cavalry never broke and they were
able to finish off the snake as it tried to run away.  This brought me straight
back to my first experiences with Dominions when I didn't know exactly how strong
a god actually is.  Even the Earth Serpent can be killed by a foolish rush into
an indie province.

In despair, I send a message to the whole world letting them know my bid for the
thrones of ascension has died along with my pretender.  However, I troop along
intending to at least be someone's ally in a dramatic battle later in the game.

My only hope for expansion now is to start pumping out lancer units.  A large
enough group of them along with my prophet or another H3 priest should be able
to quickly do enough damage to indie troops to rout them.  The problem is, I needed
a turn to make a prophet (I was waiting until I bought my most expensive mage to
do that), and a few turns to build up an army that can clear indies without taking
many losses.

I also decided to forego research and instead Call God, to try and revive my snake
before his usefulness is entirely gone.  Another good use for powerful priests.
It takes ~50 priest levels of Call God to finish the task.  So an H2 and H3 could
revive the god in about 10 turns.

Thankfully, after spending the two turns to build up, I was able to take a village
province which significantly boosted my income.  So even though I only had four 
provinces after the 7th turn (fall), my gold income was still decent enough that
I could afford troops and expensive mages.  Lets pick up the strategy again
at turn 8.

*** Turn 8 - Late fall
[[./late-fall.png]]

I decided that by recruiting a Royal Mallaqui, some lancers, and a bunch of human
chaff I could start a second expansion group.  Strong priests are quite valuable
for many reasons.  In this instance, the Sermon of Courage keeps my human warriors
on the field and Smite generally kills one unit per cast.  All I need to do is 
outlast the enemy morale, not destroy them.  So my prophet and the royal mallaqui
are both out there smiting dudes and hopefully i can catch up on the expansion game
a little bit.

*** Turn 12 - Finally Rolling
**** Snake v Barbarians
[[./second-snake.png]]

[[./barbarian-runaway.png]]
**** Throne Scouting
I'm sending in my current Prophet to scout the throne and die so that I
can prophetize my Royal Mallaqui and save some gold.

*** Turn 13 - Cramped by Van, Van, and Pan
[[./Turn13.png]]

My prophet turned into a mummy, so i have to send her to die again.
*** Turn 14 - the end of expansion
I have met my neighbors on all sides.  I have negotiated with Vanheim and
Vanarus to take some mountain provinces.  My previous start was much better in
terms of terrain.  I am expecting to hunker down with a ring of forts and try
to mass lance strike forces and then armies of chaff plus archers.  I need the
mountains in order to have access for easy recruitment of lots of my human
warriors.  Thankfully, I have access to Amazons, and I hope to settle and make
a longterm strategy here.
*** Turn 15 - transitioning towards war
There are still a few provinces to try to take.  I have sent messages to most of
my neighbors, trying to pick a fight that makes the most sense.  honestly I think
I would want to expand either south into Pythium or west into Vanarus.  I'd rather
know Pangaea and Vanheim were fighting than pick a battle with either of them.

One of my commanders died and is now a mummy that can capture slaves.  Upkeep goes
up, but I can begin generating hordes of chaff to fill the field so my mages can 
have time to do the work.  Now is the time to begin accumulating these freespawn,
organizing archer and lancer forces, and focusing my research based on which
neighbor I go to war with.  Which brings me to...

**** Researching my opponents
As the rule of war says, knowing your enemy and yourself, never lose a battle.
Nazca's units are flexible, but I need to know who I'm up against to decide 
what to send into battle.  Its time to research my opponents:

***** Pangaea
***** Vanarus
***** Pythium
***** Vanheim

*** Turn 16
*** Turn 17
*** Turn 18
*** Turn 19 - Scouting
*** Turn 20 - Stale
I found Pangaea's army but ended up staling the turn

[[./Turn21-VanheimAlliance.png]]
**** Border With Pangaea
[[./Turn21-PangaeaBorder.png]]

**** Border With Vanarus
[[./Turn21-VanarusBorder.png]]

Vanarus and I had agreed to exchange provinces a while back and they
finally came to take mine.  I had invested 15 PD in it which bought
me some time while he built a raiding party, but cost me a bunch of
gold.  At least I get to look at some of his troops in battle.

[[./Turn21-VanarusHirdman.png]]
[[./Turn21-VanarusRaid.png]]

*** Turn 22 - Bandar Log Becomes the Target - I go for a Throne
I received a message from Vanheim that the Bandar have declared war.  It feels
useful to have at least one neighbor as an ally during the first war, and the
Bandar seem like as good a target as any.  We'll have to see what else happens
with my other neighbors to see if I can actually deal with a full scale war
against them.  Having a small border with Bandar is helpful, but if they recruit
Vanarus to be on their side, I will have trouble dealing with both.  I am not
going to attack them this turn, I will wait to see where they go... meanwhile
I am going to take my neighboring throne.

**** Throne attack
[[./Turn22-moving-to-throne.png]]
[[./Turn22-army.png]]
This may not be the best idea since war is looming, but I have only committed to
attacking Bandar with Vanheim.  And my plan is to move west against them anyhow so...
I want to take the throne that neighbors my capital.  I have armies all in position,
and lots of archers with flaming arrows.  I'm hoping the arrows will discourage the
foot troops, and my flying warriors can attack rear and kill the mages quick.

I should probably script some of my priests to cast banish, now that I think of it,
there are death mages there that can hurt me.

In prepping for the battle, I realized my research has left me void of decent combat 
spells.  I have blindly gone for flaming arrows and horde of skeletons, and have no
evocations that my Acalas can cast in battle.  I also have not researched communion,
so my plan to use the amazons as slaves to my Coya is moot.  Next turn I will get
communion, and then I'll have to be more purposeful about research for the war.

**** Bandar Against Van, Pan Against Abysia
[[./Turn22-message-from-bandar.png]]
[[./Turn22-pangaeas-army.png]]

*** Turn 23 - Guardians of the Golden Throne defeated! 
*/Late Winter Year 2/*

My army took the throne with only 30 losses.  I'm glad because I 
have news that makes me feel that is time to attack.

**** Committing to Attack Pangaea
I decide to attack Pan's fort on my border.  I can mass Hatun Runas that I don't
mind dying in the castle fight.  I can crack the fort quick and swarm the smaller
contingent of white centaurs already there before reinforcements come.  Hope
Vanheim will see the same thing I do.

Bandar Log successfully convinced me not to attack him.  His dominion is death.
Pangaea land is much more attractive, and now I know Pan has gotten a good
expansion and a Running start on killing of Abysia.  @jedinja and i kindof
started our MP experience together, and i feel somewhat compelled to attack
his attacker and keep him in the game.  If Pan can't kill Abysia without taking
too many losses, and I'm taking his lands, maybe he will talk.  I'd be fine 
if Pan and Abysia exhausted each other.  Someone else would pick up the scraps
of Abysia though....

*** Turn 24 - Golden Throne Claimed - Flying to Pans Border

*** Turn 25 - Wish that Castle had Cracked
I didn't bring enough fliers to crack the fort in a single turn.
I should have possibly delayed one more turn, but I'm in it now.
Hopefully, the walls will fall within a season and I can storm the
fort before reinforcements arrive.  I have backups already coming
and feel pretty safe, unless Pythium suprises me.  I should get 
some more scouts.  Vanarus could suprise me as well.  We shall see!
*** Turn 26 - Storming the Castle
Troops in place, walls broken, formed up to fight!
*** Turn 27 - A New Fort
**** Defended by a single Priest

Very happy with my gain of Gent.  It feels like whatever else may happen in this
war, I should be able to hold this fortress.  I am glad I missed on wrecking its
construction because I got a good deal on this well positioned fortress!
*** Turn 28 - Pythium Joins the Fray
**** Viability of Archers
  - Good against some of the Vans
  - need foot army to support, go for undead?
  - flyer strikers way on the flanks, attack rear?
**** Machiavelli
Talk about the interesting diplomatic possibilities, the real life feeling of
being rival pretenders.
*** Turn 29 - A Bitter Loss, Foolish Mistake
Assuming Pythium would just sit and siege my fort, I moved a Coya into a very
vulnerable position and she lost her mortal body.  Wouldn't have been so terrible
except it requires the sacrifice of one of the Incas in play.  Just so happened
to take my Crystal Shield wearing friend, and the shield as well.  That is a heavy
investment to lose (there may even have been other items) for a single death.
Two slow-to-recruit mages and a crystal shield for a Royal Mallaqi, 340g/year
that can summon supayas 2 per turn, as well as being a powerful mage.  Too bad
they can't wear a shield.  That crystal shield is probably wrapped up in a mummy
bundle just waiting to be used.  Instead i'll have to burn a gem and cast Power of
the Spheres manually... at least she's an innate caster :\

**** Dealing With Emotion
I had some frustrated feelings over the loss.  Some unfairness that I can recover
items lost on the battlefield, but not one that was worn by a commander my priests
sacrificed to become a Royal Mallaqi.  I sent a message to Pythium about how their
foolish mistake has doomed them to be wiped from the earth.  I really didn't want 
to continue my turn, and just be moody about it for a while.  Instead I convinced
myself to stay bold and rush the next Pan fort with flyers while moving the archer
army into place.  Meanwhile my emotional response to Pythium is to swarm their 
pathetic merc army with mages and hope to wipe it clean out.  Unfortunately he's
got a pack of Harbinger beings that really scare me, and I hope they won't join
the battle and instead keep raiding my territories.  I believe that if I can smash
this invasion, perhaps I can divert some resources to conquering Pythium in
retribution.  Their capital is close and nicely placed, Pan may want to settle with
me if I take another fort.  I can be happy with those gains.  With humans as the
other Pretenders, it is much more interesting to wage wars and look for opportunity.

**** Break from Diplomacy
I really wanted to try to seed some more action in game.  I should communicate with
Vanarus, Pythium, Pangaea... really everyone.  I need to avoid expanding too big,
looking TOO powerful, otherwise I will be taken down.  Vanheim is pretty scary,
it might be worth stabbing them in the back, but I'm so busy with other wars.
Do I just try to scare Pythium, take my gains from Pan and then hit Vanheim in the
back while they slog through Bandar Log?  Vanarus would stand to gain from a weak
Pythium and Pan and could become my main enemy.  It appears it will likely be
war with the Vans both, in the not too distant future.

*** Turn 30 - Two Victories
/Early Fall Year 3/

**** Accident With Pan
I didn't expect Pan to come out, so my ground army bumped into a group of white
centaurs and minotaurs.  Even though my lines weren't formed well to protect my
archers, my numbers and magic superiority gave me a good feeling about the outcome.

**** Scrap with Pythium
Thankfully I had scripted mages for this fight, and roughly arranged troops so 
my mages could hopefully win the long battle.  However, I should have anticipated
meeting the Harbingers as well and tried to do something to take them out.  As it
was, I won the battle with skele spam and archers that didn't rout.  And I only
succeeded in routing their most important units.  The mercs are all dead but those
magic thugs will be a continuing problem.  They escaped back to the besieged fort
in Myritland.  For now, I am retreating back to the capitol.  They don't have enough
troops to break the walls, and though my people inside will start to starve in a 
month or two, it is nothing of consequence in the grand scheme.  I will attack 
when I know I can kill the Harbingers and cause Pythium a setback.

There will be legends written about this battle, where four crystal priestesses
gave their lives in communion, and a fifth left alive feebleminded.  The magic of
two Coyas and a Royal Mallaqi prophet saved the day.  Many troops were killed.

**** Chat with Vanheim

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Bing-Bong: I will need to apologize for being a poor ally, mainly due to
my inexperience, sorry about this, I made a mistake the time it will take
to besiege the bandar capital, i misunderstood what it said in the manual,
i thought strength means the number of units in the army, when it actually
means and calculate the strength rating of each individual unit. I thought
I can get the capital to surrender in two turns by the numbers I have

Bing-Bong: hey nice work on Pan, I saw you defeat two armies in the news,
as for me, things are getting slower, i thought Bandar was gonna swing
a relief for their capital thru 66, moved my army there for a decisive
battle, but he stayed put. my armies are starving, it seems the game starve
more units than the supply shortage would say.
Bing-Bong: Pan asking me for help again. I told them it was their fault
hehe.
Kid Icarus: right on.  I have been lucky with Pan.  I accidentally bumped
their army, expecting them to stay put.  but i had scripted mages and superior
numbers, so i ended up killing everything except the mages (which may have
died on retreat) ... only about 25 white centaurs, but not bad
Kid Icarus: you're a fine ally.  invading bandar sounded bad when i saw
their dominion.  i have hit that food issue before too.  it isn't super
intuitive
Kid Icarus: i believe units eat supply units by their size
Kid Icarus: so humans gonna eat like 2 supply units a month
Bing-Bong: yeah by its by size, but I'm only 20 supply points short, but
its seems half my army has the starving quality
Kid Icarus: yeah i think its like... not enough food for the whole army,
everyone can starve
Kid Icarus: sucks.  move some out for a turn and then back.  avoid disease
at all costs
Kid Icarus: maybe take out provinces with magic sites?
Bing-Bong: yeah that's why I can't give battle this turn, and will have
to move back to supply
Kid Icarus: no problem.  i have to deal with Pythium now
Bing-Bong: scouts don't seem to find magic sites by others, I don't know
where they are
Kid Icarus: hmm, i dont remember now what you need
Bing-Bong: is pythium attacking you?
Kid Icarus: yeah, from the south
Bing-Bong: Pan has been desperate lately for allies
Kid Icarus: they sieged a fort, and then killed one of my Coyas which caused
another one of my mages to be sacrificed :\
Kid Icarus: i just chased off a merc army, but missed their Harbingers...
three scary thugs
Bing-Bong: how big is the pythium force?
Kid Icarus: not big.  i killed a bit of their bulk, and the mercs. only
like 50 units sieging now, but some powerful summons and hydras
Kid Icarus: i had to retreat too, so probably we'll both have to regroup
a turn
Kid Icarus: Vanarus may be headed for Pan too.  I cant tell
Kid Icarus: Van army at 132
Kid Icarus: Pan fort at 112
Bing-Bong: is 132 vanrus's capital?
Kid Icarus: no, 7 is Vanarus
Bing-Bong: ok i think vanarus is loyal ally
Kid Icarus: it appears so
Kid Icarus: im nervous about invisible troops but hey... you have em too
Kid Icarus: sanwiched by Vans ;)
Bing-Bong: don't worry about my van's I haven't recruited much because
they are expensive
Bing-Bong: and my bless effects aren't good anyway
Bing-Bong: Pythium capital in 142 has 70 units mainly principes with 3
hydras
Kid Icarus: don't give away too much, loyal allies in Dominions are your
next targets ;)
Bing-Bong: yeah i figure we are getting to close
Kid Icarus: But I appreciate our work togethre so far
Bing-Bong: haha
Bing-Bong: i don't have much scouts in pythium
Kid Icarus: but no worries, i will be busy with pan soon i think.  i see
white centaurs coming this way
Kid Icarus: I'm not too worried about pythium
Kid Icarus: i just have to be smart with them, not endanger my mages like
i did
Kid Icarus: i can afford to lose a fort too
Bing-Bong: Pythium can't be that weak, it's already turn 30, he must have
a large force somewhere
Kid Icarus: yeah i know right?
Kid Icarus: i just haven't seen it
Kid Icarus: i think maybe he keeps buying mercs?
Kid Icarus: and hydras
Bing-Bong: yeah seems to be
Kid Icarus: hydras are expensive
Bing-Bong: his borders to mine are 0 defense
Kid Icarus: and if he's keeping them, their upkeep is expensive
Kid Icarus: if you want some free territory, go for it.  you might have
luck with some thugs/van raiding parties
Kid Icarus: choke out bandar
Kid Icarus: they dont have much of a fight i think either
Bing-Bong: yeah I actually thought after we done with Pan and Bandar, we
go after Pythium next
Kid Icarus: Well i obviously need to punish them ;)
Kid Icarus: it was so tragic losing that Coya
Kid Icarus: and now she's part of a mummy bundle bent on revenge
Bing-Bong: is that for reals? mummies, haven't played with nazca yet so
don't know yet
Kid Icarus: yeah for real
Kid Icarus: its crazy
Kid Icarus: this is my first time
Kid Icarus: my winged Moon Queen dies.  they mummify her, but ALSO one
of my Sun Kings across at my other border to make a new unit that is their
mummies being carried around on a throne
Kid Icarus: but my Sun King has my newly forged shield on that cost a bunch
of gems.  the shield... GONE
Kid Icarus: so i lose two mages and some magic items to get one double
mummy mage
Kid Icarus: its weird
Bing-Bong: mummy mages, sounds cool, you need extra gems? so you can replace
it? i can send some
Kid Icarus: im low on earth gems
Bing-Bong: I'll send you a dozen
Kid Icarus: i have water gems to trade too.  air and death cant hurt
Kid Icarus: i can't do anything with water right now
Bing-Bong: do you use fire gems
Kid Icarus: yes
Bing-Bong: okay was thinking of asking for fire, because i'm low on them
Kid Icarus: i can spare some
Bing-Bong: i'll redo my turn and send you gems, so you can have them by
next turn
Kid Icarus: +1
Kid Icarus: i'll send 13 fire gems
Bing-Bong: okay i send a dozen earth plus six air and six death
Kid Icarus: awesome.
Bing-Bong: As for pythium, I will recruit a war party, then send do some
marauding to them, maybe at least 3 turns, maybe by that time too I already
have bandar capital
Kid Icarus: yeah youll miss a good chance to expand if you dont
Bing-Bong: I will surprise him
Kid Icarus: abysia might look their too if pan backs off completely
Kid Icarus: *there
Bing-Bong: We tell abyssia that pan has recruited pythium as allies
Bing-Bong: he owes us one
Kid Icarus: Oh yeah, that is a good idea
Kid Icarus: definitely
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Turn 31 - Stall Pythium, Storm Pangaea
/Fall Year 3/

I need to regroup in the south, so I sent a message to Pythium trying to
capitalize on their fear. They fear being the next target, but brought
it upon themselves. They'd be better off looking for a strong ally to stab
in the back than this pre-emptive attack. I revealed to them my advice
to Vanheim to go take their lands instead of Bandar, perhaps they will
leave off my fort and head another direction. If they stay too long, they
will lose their army when the flying warriors descend.

I should probably keep pushing into Pan's territory rather than storming
another probably empty fort with my elite army. I could take a chance and
march on toward the capitol, but I know there's still a large White Centaur
army out there. I'd rather them go after Vanarus scavenging up my scraps.
In fact, if Pan wanted peace, I'd settle with these two forts, and let
him focus on Vanarus while I make preparations for the next move. Vanheim
is really the strongest opponent in terms of troops besides myself. If
I can look ahead a few seasons, the whole world is going to revolt against
me if I roll over Pan. I'll be too strong. I'd rather embroil the others
in sides against the Vans. If I can suprise Vanheim perhaps I can eliminate
my biggest immediate threat, and then attempt a throne rush.

**** Endgame look ahead As my Pangaea campaign has gone so well and I
have one throne, I must look at using my greatest strength to take advantage
of my tentative lead. Flying H3 mages. If I can take the throne to my south
casually, then I am in position (I think) to fly into 3 other throne provinces
on one turn. This army would need to be able to chase off any defence,
and survive a turn while the priest claims the throne. I should plan out
these strike forces, including survivability gear for my commanders. Incas
and skelespam Hurin priests might do the trick at this point in the game.

*** Turn 32 - Its a Trap!  Bandar Monkeys Spring
Vanheim completed the siege of Bandar Log and stormed the castle.  What I imagined
would be a slaughter of monkies was a big suprise.  The demilich Chaos Ape was inside 
with a cadre of gurus all amped up in communions.  A group of 30 mages was able to wipe
out an army 500 strong, including chasing off a diseased, wounded Raven of the Underworld.
Vanheim may not recover well from this loss.  It looks like the game may have gotten
slightly easier for me.  However, two of my target thrones will be in Bandar control, so
I need a way to deal with these astral mages.

So glad I had scouts in place to watch the battle... getting spoiled with a flying nation

**** Winding Down with Pan, Gearing Up for Pythium

I have decided to stall one more turn with Pythium.  I was going to attack the invading
army and try to also cut off their retreat to ensure the Harbingers will die.  But I 
did not feel confident about the survivability of my mages.  Just not enough troops to 
feel comfortable sending two Coyas and an Inca into heated battle.  I have one anti-thug
to try and kill off the Harbingers but it will be tough.  Let them keep coming in, I have
nothing to lose nearby and they don't have easy backup.

I can be satisfied with my gains from Pan, and I should be grateful that I hardly had
to fight for it.  However, I am a bit annoyed at Vanarus being so opportunistic and
coming in to take provinces for free.  I'm hoping to just leave off with Pan, and perhaps
they will go after the easier target since I'm across a river.

Also, it may be good to pick off some of the Bandar territories that were taken from 
Vanheim, as well as others.  We need to restrict their gem income.

*** Turn 33 - Pythium Listens to Wisdom, Nazca Ponders the Future

I relented and did not attack Pythium because I could see no value in it beyond 
swatting down a powerful but vulnerable pest.  It would be preferable if that
pest went along to bother someone else.  I received a message from them that looks
like they are faltering.  I ought to convince them to be my ally and take the spoils
of war I give.  I can only expect betrayal some day, but so be it.  Fight me now
and die, or look for easy profit elsewhere and plot an upset.  There's plusses on 
both sides for both sides.  I for one, would rather turn attention to the largest
threat to my ascendency... which for now looks like it could be Vanarus.

**** The Future...
I must begin at once to organize the throne capturing squads.  At least 3 squads
with one or more H3 flying priest and geared for shock and awe.  I'd love to drop
in, rout the enemy in a quick blow of buffed lances and axes, and have defenders
left to hold a turn for throne claiming.  I should also research globals that may
help me defend casually while I put effort into preparing the throne squads.

**** Sending out the Thought Streams
Just stirring the pot.  Keep the minds on war, when I want only thrones.

*** Turn 34 - Reconfiguring Conflict

Right now, I'm mostly trying to build up the forces I need to try a multi-throne
assault.  I will try to take one of my nearby thrones 'quietly' and not claim it
perhaps... instead waiting with someone there to claim it when the time comes.

Hopefully I can lay low and defend myself from possible attackers while riding my
small advantage to the win.  I really don't want to start another war at this time.

I am trying to engineer the other nations to keep at battle with one another.
I think Nazca may have a bit of fear since they were able to defeat Pangaea in the
field several times.  However, I have seen that Pan has adopted Arrow Fend which
makes my archers less valuable.  I should really keep someone who can cast 
Earthquake near the Pan lines (i've seen Gift of Flight too though) and move
my archers toward Bandar and the Vans.  Pythium has Principes with tower shields,
so I need something else to deal with them.  I have been making kits to try and 
kill the Harbingers... they have Awe 5 and cast Mistform and other buffs.  Seems
like I need a unit+kit that has very high morale, strength and attack skill.
Elf Bane is perfect to deal damage, but I have to hit the thing first.  I wonder
if a hit against Mistform that would be reduced to 1 damage will then trigger
the Elf Bane ability to Slay Magic?  I think I ought to kit some flyers lightly
with Elf Banes and do a few self-buffs to then Attack Flyers and try to kill
off the Harbingers if I have to face them again.  They'll be handy against 
Bandar as well.  

**** Feebleminded Amazon Recovers Her Senses!

*** Turn 35 - Emissaries Return from Diplomatic Quests
**** Pangaea's Truce
I am glad I waited for Pan to come to me, this truce feels like it comes at
the perfect time.
**** Vanheim's information
**** Bandar Log's Missive
Bandar is loyal to Pan and requests that I stop attacking.  It is all working
out too well.  Bandar was my ally's enemy, but now we appear to be gaining trust
and cooperation with one another.  I wanted to quit with Pan anyhow, and now I
get to make friends by doing so.  Maybe I should have played the diplomacy a bit
more sly, saying it is a big deal to give up on Pan.  I am afraid that Vanarus
may profit too much, but if that happens, my next military target will be clear.
**** Gem Search and Forging
I'm feeling very low on gems.  Especially earth gems.  I am moving units to attack
my nearby throne but also getting my search on.  I must use this lull in the fight
to expand my economy, and gems is the way to do that.  My gold income is pretty
good and I can maintain this army and keep building.  I'd love to be able to cast
Trade Wind but even though I have an Air 3 mage, I can't boost it because the 
air boosters cost at least 4.  I can build Crystal Coins and boost my Astral magic,
which is becoming an interesting path for me.  I have decided to mostly go in
Conjuration for the end game and work on supplementing my fliers with beefy 
summoned troops.  We shall see.  There is one spell I will have access to, Ether
Gate, which seems to get me an elite squad for a decent price in Astral pearls.

*** Turn 36 - Attacking a Second Throne
Taking the Erf Snek and some flyers to attack a nearby throne, also have enough
Incas now to move toward the other thrones needed.  However, Bandar has moved
the demilich to his near throne, and killed a hundred more of Vanheim's troops.
Looks like Vanheim is going to falter.  The Pan throne province was lost to Vanarus
but will probably be reclaimed.  I think Pangaea will be too busy chasing them 
down to think of protecting the throne too much.  If things go well, I hope to 
be in place for the final throne assault in a few turns.  No need to rush it yet,
but I really should take this chance.

*** Turn 37 - Thrones Fall
Three battles in throne provinces.  I took one with minor casualties, Pythium
took another right near me.  Let us hope he doesn't guard it too carefully, I
hoped to take that one in just a few more turns.  Pan retook his throne from
Vanarus, and we will have to see how that one ends up guarded.  Pan has at least
90 white centaurs roaming yet, i'm sure theres a few dozen more out there.  Bandar
is seeming to offer support for my path to victory, i dont know if that extends 
to me taking his provinces or not.

This turn, I decided to go ahead and claim the throne.  Bandar has 2, and Pythium
will too.  So there will be a three way tie for the lead.  I believe I'm the only
one capable of possibly going for 3 at once on a turn.  That is a very tall order
though, and will rely heavily on coyas and incas.  lets hope they can do it.

I did get a windfall of gems, and I will get Construction 6 next turn, so I need
to do my best at kitting mages for survival.  My great hope is that some flyers 
backed by masses of Hurin priests skelespamming can out last a counter attack while
my Incas claim the throne after i take the province.  this means i have to ensure
the incas and other mages stay alive in the first battle.  ugh.  I guess for the
Pythium throne, I can use the Earth Serpent and perhaps drop some earthquake on
it.  That and be ready to take out a Harbinger.

*** Turn 38 - Change of Plans
Bandar built a castle in the swamp of his throne.  I will no longer be able to 
take it in a turn, it will be a slog and a tough fight.  I have decided to research
to Alteration 6 and get Crumble.  I can also summon Condors and bring undead into
that land but I will need some time before taking that throne is feasible.

**** Pan and Vanarus Clash
Finally, the big battle I was waiting for.  Both sides took heavy casualties, as
I had hoped.  That throne at least is going to be up for grabs.  However, I cast
Ascasic Record on Vanarus and see that they must be leading the game in provinces
and gold.  They have no thrones, but I think for the longer game I must play, I 
should attack Vanarus and take as much territory as possible.  Let Pan counterattack
and keep my truce with them for a time, but I should aim to begin the final push
against Pan after a short time.  If I can take the land, I think I will end up with
a lead that can't be shaken, even if Bandar and Pythium attack me together.  I 
decided to send Vanarus a declaration of war, just to be honorable like that.

The mummies forsee the end of Pan and the Vans, with the Monkey, the Eagle and the
Seven Headed Snake vying for ultimate power.

*** Turn 39 - Descending on Vanarus

I'm very tired, so i didn't plan a grand scheme this turn.  i'm flying into as many
territories as i can near Vanarus' capitol.  I hope to draw his army out a ways
and then fly behind it and siege the castle when he's gone.  I have a feeling other
nations will turn on me soon, so i have to avoid losses as much as possible.  
Especially Incas and Coyas, which I will try to keep out of it as much as I can.
*** Turn 40 - Stale
My invasion went pretty flawlessly aside from losing a ton of axemen to a few
heavy infantry.  then i had to sleep from being unwell and missed orders for this
turn

*** Turn 41 - Aim for a fight
I am converging on the farm province hoping Vanarus' army will attack there.

*** Turn 42 - Missed Fight, Eyes of God, Decisions
Vanarus did not attack, they have several armies to the south near Pythium.
Perhaps they were on their way there to attack and help Vanheim?  Not sure what
to do now...
  
  - [ ] Swing back against pythium for the throne province?
    quicker game possibly, more enemies, throne grab with crumble
  - [X] Continue fighting Vanarus? 
    longer game, economy advantage, keep fighting situations I know 
    I can win.

After casting Eyes of God, it looks like I can clinch a pretty good lead if I 
take Vanarus.  I already have a pretty good shot, I think if this goes ok I can
then be large enough to push through the win.  It is possible I should just
regroup and aim for the thrones again, but I decided to go ahead and attack
the Vanarus capitol.

*** Turn 43 - Siege of Vanarus
I'm slightly nervous about this... but I'm keeping my army at Vanarus even
though his main army is adjacent.  It seems like I should be able to take them,
but even against his PD, I lost about twice as many troops as he lost.  This
army has a lot of HP concentrated in the Yetis though, so maybe I can hit a few
spells in the opening, then on turn three get a big HP drop on the Yetis with
attack large enemy monsters.  If that doesn't work, I'm not sure how well I
will last in a long battle.  I should probably move more troops in to support
but I'm feeling lazy and he's got nothing else close enough.

If this goes well I believe I can ensure my victory.

*** Turn 44 - Frost Father Stalls
/Late Fall, Year 4/
 
Vanarus did not attack the sieging force as I expected.  I checked the staling
log and they have staled the last two turns :( i hope Gintanama is alright IRL
and that this is simply bad luck/timing or perhaps a broken desire to fight.

Flying hordes are definitely scary.  It feels terrible to lose several provinces
in one turn, and then have an army converge on your capitol while your pretender
marches around with one of your best armies half the size of the horde.

However, I lost twice as many troops fighting against the PD, and I could take
a major loss here if things do not go well.  The past two turns could have 
positioned an army in place, and I have no escape.  If I rout, I lose it all.
I took a big risk here, Vanarus troops are strong enough that it would have been
worth a confrontation.  I guess there is this last turn yet, I have to storm the
fort.

I wonder if my smaller force of humans can move in on Frost Father and prevent
his move to Vanarus?

I just sent in my turn, and noticed Vanarus has too this time.  The moment of
truth awaits....

*** Turn 45 - Vanarus Awakens
/Early Winter, Year 4/

Frost Father attacked, and as expected, I lost :(  I don't think my tactics were
great and my army makeup needs some better heavy hitters, or more mages.  I did
do a good deal of damage, but lost a ton of troops as well... most of it is easily
replaced, and I didn't lose any mages.  I'm moving in some extra troops and hope
to keep wearing him down.  I hope Pythium will keep him busy but I am now becoming
afraid of both Pan and Pythium.  It seems like Vanheim and Pythium may have made
a truce as well, and I may have enemies all around soon.  Wishing I had been more
bold about trying to grab thrones.  I have a lead, but there's no reason it can't
be upset.  Elite units all around could tear through the birdmen if I'm not 
careful.

**** Retreat
My forces failed to stand up to the fierce warriors and pretender god.  Not a 
total disaster, but it could have gone better.  If only my intercepting army
plan had worked :/ ... Vanarus has had a lot of gold to buy elite troops, so
I will have to find a way to win with magic.

*** Turn 46 Preparing the Second Wave
/Winter, Year 4/

All is looking well, despite the loss.  I am moving more troops into position, 
as well as building more temples and just gearing up in general to do what must
be done to win.  I noticed that the Bandar demilich is in a neigboring province
now, but I expect he's still aiming at Vanheim.  However, I know that the throne
I wanted is open too.  In fact, all three of them are pretty open at the moment.
I wish I felt bold enough to just go for it, but I'm concered about Pythium's 
arch angels.  I need to do more research.  It would be nice to try and engineer
a suprise win, but I don't have enough logistics knowledge to figure out if I 
could actually knock down a fort in one turn, storm, and claim a throne without
being destroyed.  At least Pan doesn't have a fort up on his.

I'm summoning more condors, which have extra siege power. I could build some
Gate Cleavers, and I think it could be done.  But the focus now is the war on
Vanarus, which if I stay the course, I believe can be won with good profit.

It looks like Abysia and Vanheim are petering out, while Bandar is threatening
to spread ugly dominion everywhere.  I'm going to have to possibly up my preaching
game to see about winning some of that battle ahead of time.

*** Turn 47 - Moving In
/Late Winter, Year 4/

*** Turn 48 - Second Siege
/Early Spring, Year 5/

I hit the castle hard, while Vanarus moved out to attack the adjacent cavalry
army.  The walls have already been breached, and I will not fall back.  The 
decision will come here!

*** Turn 49 - Vanarus falls, Eyes of God Blinded
/Spring, Year 5/
Unfortunately, Vanarus staled again and I walked right into the capitol.
Now it seems certain that the world will turn against me.  I shall have to keep
my eyes on the prize and aim at the 3 thrones.  If I am invaded, perhaps I 
abandon the forts and put all effort into the throne rush.  O boy....

My Coya also suffered the Fate of Oedipus and lost the Eyes of God.  No matter,
I know my position in the world and now must consolidate victory.  Abysia gifted
me a load of fire gems as Jedinja falls (thanks! i'll do my best!).  I'm summoning
creatures to be my heavy hitters... yetis, fire drakes, banes.  My plan is to have
a skeleton plus archer army for invading Bandar Log.  For Pythium I think some 
thugs and regular troops will do.  Against Pan... Earth magic.  I should move
the earth serpent towards Pangaea.  Sending the snake some gems for earthquakes.

Boy this game can get really complex in logistics.  Very hard to just end turn!

*** Turn 50 - Resieged
/Late Spring, Year 5/

Now my mage army is trapped in Vanarus.  The sieging army can't damage the walls
though, and Pythium continues to defeat the roving Van armies.  I'm moving the
Snek into range of the battle, and really hoping to be set up for what is to come.

I imagine Bandar and Pangaea will converge upon me together at some point.  Bandar
asked for a 10 turn peace treaty and i'm fine with that.  i will not attack Bandar
until i am ready to take a throne.  Pythium or Pan should be my next target.

And probably Pan, I am better situated to defend against Pythium, and to go
offensive against Pan.  But that will turn bandar against me for good, unless
Chaos truly just wants to support the next Pantokrator.


*** False start
**** Year 1 - Spring
   [[./Turn1.png]]

  I am pleased with my start position.  For now I have limited access to capitol,
  and I should probably be able to keep the mountain passes closed from the East.

  I decided to send my inital army along with Zuzu because they can't do anything
  themselves anyway, and maybe it will prevent disaster.  I don't think Zuzu would
  get killed, but I've had occasional bad luck with Awake Expanders that end up 
  getting killed by hordes of wolf tribe or barbarians.  I'll recruit two turns
  worth of human spearmen and maybe some more archers while the commander is away
  and then maybe I can have a solo snake and one expansion army by turn 3.

**** Year 1 - Late Spring
The Earth Snake succeeds, while my human troops die.  The cave I invaded had an army
of Zotz in it.  They are quite weak, but strong enough to swarm my human warriors and
kill half of them and the human commander before they ran off.

[[./turn2-losses.png]]

Surprisingly, I am surrounded by unique indie troops.  There's Zotz, Lavaborn, Amazons,
plus more common Wolf Tribe and Barbarians.  This province "The Hole" has a summonable
death mage, the Camazotz.

[[./camazotz.png]]

The exciting thing about this is the combination of flying, stealth, and magic on this
unit.  Also it can lead 40 troops.  I'm thinking this will be a great asset in this MP
game.  With the right magic, perhaps a few of these leading the stealthy Zotz from the
same province could make a suprise attack against weak PD, or a Fort or Palisades.

Unfortunately right now, I'd prefer having taken a human province so I could recruit
a cheap commander for my armies.  I want to keep recruiting mages in my capitol.
Zuzu the Earth Serpent heads for the Wolf Tribe with the rest of the starting archers.
I had an Earth Mother ripped apart by Wolf Tribe testing pretender builds for this game.
The Earth Serpent's protection is much, much, higher so I think he'll be alright.

**** Year 1 - Early Summer
[[./turn3-losses.png]]

Once again, I lose half of my forces, this time its my Archers which I was hoping to build
up into a mass at some point.  Oh well.  Instead, I am recruiting the flying lancer units.
It seems like one of Nazca's strategies is to hit as hard as possible on the first turn.
The pre-emptive strike of a large mass of lance hits could knock down the total HP of a
squad so hard, they'll begin routing immediately.  This allows them to be killed off much
more easily.  If the lancers take a few casualties and their squat routes, hopefully its
no big deal.  They will fly away, and my guarded mages can blast away with fireballs and
lightning bolts or sit behind a horde of skeletons to finish the job.  The idea with a
lancer army though is to only go up against smaller armies, hit big, hit hard, and route
them.  I hope to have commanders lead lancer squads that can break away, kill PD and hit
the enemy economy hard all in one turn.  Stay on the move, converge on obvious targets,
and provide seige support when needed.

I need to figure out the other type of army I want to lead, probably mages with sun guards
and summons.  We'll get back to this.

***** Going for the Amazons
My immediate inclination is to circle Zuzu around the capitol to capture the Amazon
province.  Then I'll need a lab and temple there to begin hiring the astral mages.
With this in mind, I think I will go for the Earthquake strategy and the Earth/Death
mages, the Coya and Hurin Priest.
