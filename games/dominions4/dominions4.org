** TODO unicode or some kind of link for displaying the dominions icons
  [[./dom4-icons/Path_F.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_A.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_W.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_D.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_N.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_B.png]]

  it would be cool to have [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]]6 instead of E6 for magic somehow.
  some kind of unicode support or something?  If i'm thinking about publishing with this,
  i just have to ensure that it displays in a reasonable way.  For now i suppose I can
  copy and paste from these and view it in emacs.
