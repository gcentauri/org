  | Unit         | Original Morale | Terror |
  |--------------+-----------------+--------|
  | Triton       |               9 |      4 |
  | Aphroi       |              14 |        |
  | Icthycentaur |              15 |        |

  | Icthysatyr   |               7 |        |

  It appears that Terror reduces morale by 5, but temporarily.  At some point
  it looked like units morale went back up to 7, unless the 5 units got killed 
  and i missed it.  Regardless, units routed very quickly, even with just a 
  small portion of their line being hit with terror.
