** MA Nazca - January 2018 - Jedinja's "NewCornerSuperRumble"
*** TODO Prelude
**** Pretender
  I have decided to go with an awake Earth Snake with level 6 earth magic.
  While I really wanted to take a dormant "rainbow" to fill out magic paths and
  provide minor blesses to my many sacred mages, I just had too much trouble 
  expanding with Nazca's troops.  I could carve out a decent little stronghold,
  but against the AI, I ended up starting to run low on gold and needing to expand
  more.  I started one war and then quickly was attacked by two other neighbors
  that ended my game.

  [[./Zuzu.png]]

  The [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]]6 Earth Snake is one of the easiest pretenders to use for expansion.  Having
  earth 6 gives extra protection (a side benefit of earth magic paths) and reinvigoration
  to the all sacred troops (great for mages and armored troops like Nazca's!).  This
  snake should be able to scare off indie troops on its own (it has Fear too!) and allow
  for a much quicker expansion in the first year.  Nazca needs lots of gold to support
  the mummified elders, and taking territory will be the best way to ensure that.

  This pretender will really play its biggest role in that first year, but thankfully
  it is cheap enough that it can provide decent scales to boost our gold and magic 
  ability.  I took Growth, Luck, and Magic 3 to accomplish that.  I hear Luck + Magic 
  synergize well with the events that will occur.  A little Turmoil won't hurt, and will
  increase the amount events slightly.  Sloth 2 because none of my troops require many
  resources (we'll talk about them next), and Cold 1 is default for Nazca.  Perhaps I
  should have taken even more Cold, one of my opponents is Abysia.  The reason I didn't
  was simply that there wasn't anything great to spend the points on.  
**** Units
  Our troops are mostly weak, our strength will come from the mobility of flying,
  and our mages.  We have a variety of weapons to deal with the troop types of our
  enemies.  Spears and lances against heavy armor (or maces if they lack helmets!)
  swords, axes and missles against chaff.  I suppose our maces could help against
  undead nations as well.  We also have decent archers that can back up a skeleton
  army or have flaming arrows, etc etc.  We will have to be quick and smart.  Harrassing
  the enemy and trying to force a battle on our own terms.
**** Research Plan
  Nazca's mages are quite powerful.  Coyas will be able to wear Earth Boots and reliably
  cast E4 spells with gems, and potentially without on the chance I get an E3 Coya.
  Incas are F2A2H3 and can potentially assist chaff with morale spells, archers with
  Flaming Arrows and Wind Guide, or just Evoke away and blast folks with fireballs 
  and lightning bolts.  Coyas can also summon skelespam.  If I find indie astral mages,
  then I will probably try to invest in Coya magic and try some communions as well.

  This will be a short game I'm guessing, so I should aim for spells that will be
  powerful in the midgame.

***** Earthquake - Evocation 5
  Not many of our rivals have flying units.  I think with the game settings I may be
  able to aim for using this spell to create a decisive situation allowing throne 
  captures to win.  What else will I get from Evocation?  Fireballs and lightning for
  my mages, perhaps 

***** Flaming Arrows - Enchantment 4
  Depending on our neighbors, this could be a good target.  Skeletons are also in this
  tree so we should do some good scouting to see if Enchantment is a good school.

**** Rival Pretender Nations
***** Abysia
***** Pangaea
***** Vanarus
***** Bandar Log
***** Pythium
***** Vanheim
*** Turn 1 - Spring - Fate Against Me
[[./fateful-first-move.png]]

Zuzu the Earth Serpent is boldy moving out into the neighboring province under our
dominion's control.  Generally, this is a good thing because it means the pretender
will have more hit points.  Ideally, Zuzu will scare away the indies without getting
hurt, and I will get a lead in the expansion game.  Afterall, I built my pretender
specifically for this purpose.

*** Turns 2-7 - Disaster and Despair
Unfortunately, in this instance, the blind rush into a province ended up being 
a major failure due to a large group of heavy cavalry.  I watched as Zuzu futiley
threw some flying shards at the heavily armed troops which shrugged it off.  They
had a priest encouraging them.  There was about 30 of them rather than 10-15 as
is usually seen.  Everything was wrong.  Zuzu held her ground for a while, but
eventually it seems like the fatigue must have hit a point that allowed several
big hits to land in a single turn.  Zuzu took perhaps 50-60 points of damage all
at once and began to flee.  The morale of the cavalry never broke and they were
able to finish off the snake as it tried to run away.  This brought me straight
back to my first experiences with Dominions when I didn't know exactly how strong
a god actually is.  Even the Earth Serpent can be killed by a foolish rush into
an indie province.

In despair, I send a message to the whole world letting them know my bid for the
thrones of ascension has died along with my pretender.  However, I troop along
intending to at least be someone's ally in a dramatic battle later in the game.

My only hope for expansion now is to start pumping out lancer units.  A large
enough group of them along with my prophet or another H3 priest should be able
to quickly do enough damage to indie troops to rout them.  The problem is, I needed
a turn to make a prophet (I was waiting until I bought my most expensive mage to
do that), and a few turns to build up an army that can clear indies without taking
many losses.

I also decided to forego research and instead Call God, to try and revive my snake
before his usefulness is entirely gone.  Another good use for powerful priests.
It takes ~50 priest levels of Call God to finish the task.  So an H2 and H3 could
revive the god in about 10 turns.

Thankfully, after spending the two turns to build up, I was able to take a village
province which significantly boosted my income.  So even though I only had four 
provinces after the 7th turn (fall), my gold income was still decent enough that
I could afford troops and expensive mages.  Lets pick up the strategy again
at turn 8.

*** Turn 8 - Late fall
[[./late-fall.png]]

I decided that by recruiting a Royal Mallaqui, some lancers, and a bunch of human
chaff I could start a second expansion group.  Strong priests are quite valuable
for many reasons.  In this instance, the Sermon of Courage keeps my human warriors
on the field and Smite generally kills one unit per cast.  All I need to do is 
outlast the enemy morale, not destroy them.  So my prophet and the royal mallaqui
are both out there smiting dudes and hopefully i can catch up on the expansion game
a little bit.

*** Turn 12 - Finally Rolling
**** Snake v Barbarians
[[./second-snake.png]]

[[./barbarian-runaway.png]]
**** Throne Scouting
I'm sending in my current Prophet to scout the throne and die so that I
can prophetize my Royal Mallaqui and save some gold.

*** Turn 13 - Cramped by Van, Van, and Pan
[[./Turn13.png]]

My prophet turned into a mummy, so i have to send her to die again.
*** Turn 14 - the end of expansion
I have met my neighbors on all sides.  I have negotiated with Vanheim and
Vanarus to take some mountain provinces.  My previous start was much better in
terms of terrain.  I am expecting to hunker down with a ring of forts and try
to mass lance strike forces and then armies of chaff plus archers.  I need the
mountains in order to have access for easy recruitment of lots of my human
warriors.  Thankfully, I have access to Amazons, and I hope to settle and make
a longterm strategy here.
*** Turn 15 - transitioning towards war
There are still a few provinces to try to take.  I have sent messages to most of
my neighbors, trying to pick a fight that makes the most sense.  honestly I think
I would want to expand either south into Pythium or west into Vanarus.  I'd rather
know Pangaea and Vanheim were fighting than pick a battle with either of them.

One of my commanders died and is now a mummy that can capture slaves.  Upkeep goes
up, but I can begin generating hordes of chaff to fill the field so my mages can 
have time to do the work.  Now is the time to begin accumulating these freespawn,
organizing archer and lancer forces, and focusing my research based on which
neighbor I go to war with.  Which brings me to...

**** Researching my opponents
As the rule of war says, knowing your enemy and yourself, never lose a battle.
Nazca's units are flexible, but I need to know who I'm up against to decide 
what to send into battle.  Its time to research my opponents:

***** Pangaea
***** Vanarus
***** Pythium
***** Vanheim

*** Turn 16
*** Turn 17
*** Turn 18

*** Turn 19 - Scouting

*** Turn 20 - Stale
I found Pangaea's army but ended up staling the turn

*** Turn 21 - Alliance with Vanheim - Border Control
[[./Turn21-VanheimAlliance.png]]
**** Border With Pangaea
[[./Turn21-PangaeaBorder.png]]

**** Border With Vanarus
[[./Turn21-VanarusBorder.png]]

Vanarus and I had agreed to exchange provinces a while back and they
finally came to take mine.  I had invested 15 PD in it which bought
me some time while he built a raiding party, but cost me a bunch of
gold.  At least I get to look at some of his troops in battle.

[[./Turn21-VanarusHirdman.png]]
[[./Turn21-VanarusRaid.png]]

*** Turn 22 - Bandar Log Becomes the Target - I go for a Throne
I received a message from Vanheim that the Bandar have declared war.  It feels
useful to have at least one neighbor as an ally during the first war, and the
Bandar seem like as good a target as any.  We'll have to see what else happens
with my other neighbors to see if I can actually deal with a full scale war
against them.  Having a small border with Bandar is helpful, but if they recruit
Vanarus to be on their side, I will have trouble dealing with both.  I am not
going to attack them this turn, I will wait to see where they go... meanwhile
I am going to take my neighboring throne.

**** Throne attack
[[./Turn22-moving-to-throne.png]]
[[./Turn22-army.png]]
This may not be the best idea since war is looming, but I have only committed to
attacking Bandar with Vanheim.  And my plan is to move west against them anyhow so...
I want to take the throne that neighbors my capital.  I have armies all in position,
and lots of archers with flaming arrows.  I'm hoping the arrows will discourage the
foot troops, and my flying warriors can attack rear and kill the mages quick.

I should probably script some of my priests to cast banish, now that I think of it,
there are death mages there that can hurt me.

In prepping for the battle, I realized my research has left me void of decent combat 
spells.  I have blindly gone for flaming arrows and horde of skeletons, and have no
evocations that my Acalas can cast in battle.  I also have not researched communion,
so my plan to use the amazons as slaves to my Coya is moot.  Next turn I will get
communion, and then I'll have to be more purposeful about research for the war.

**** Bandar Against Van, Pan Against Abysia
[[./Turn22-message-from-bandar.png]]
[[./Turn22-pangaeas-army.png]]


*** Turn 23 - Guardians of the Golden Throne defeated!
*/Late Winter Year 2/*

My army took the throne with only 30 losses.  I'm glad because I 
have news that makes me feel that is time to attack.


**** Committing to Attack Pangaea
I decide to attack Pan's fort on my border.  I can mass Hatun Runas that I don't
mind dying in the castle fight.  I can crack the fort quick and swarm the smaller
contingent of white centaurs already there before reinforcements come.  Hope
Vanheim will see the same thing I do.

Bandar Log successfully convinced me not to attack him.  His dominion is death.
Pangaea land is much more attractive, and now I know Pan has gotten a good
expansion and a Running start on killing of Abysia.  @jedinja and i kindof
started our MP experience together, and i feel somewhat compelled to attack
his attacker and keep him in the game.  If Pan can't kill Abysia without taking
too many losses, and I'm taking his lands, maybe he will talk.  I'd be fine 
if Pan and Abysia exhausted each other.  Someone else would pick up the scraps
of Abysia though....


*** Turn 24 - Golden Throne Claimed - Flying to Pans Border



*** Turn 25 - Wish that Castle had Cracked
I didn't bring enough fliers to crack the fort in a single turn.
I should have possibly delayed one more turn, but I'm in it now.
Hopefully, the walls will fall within a season and I can storm the
fort before reinforcements arrive.  I have backups already coming
and feel pretty safe, unless Pythium suprises me.  I should get 
some more scouts.  Vanarus could suprise me as well.  We shall see!


*** False start
**** Year 1 - Spring
   [[./Turn1.png]]

  I am pleased with my start position.  For now I have limited access to capitol,
  and I should probably be able to keep the mountain passes closed from the East.

  I decided to send my inital army along with Zuzu because they can't do anything
  themselves anyway, and maybe it will prevent disaster.  I don't think Zuzu would
  get killed, but I've had occasional bad luck with Awake Expanders that end up 
  getting killed by hordes of wolf tribe or barbarians.  I'll recruit two turns
  worth of human spearmen and maybe some more archers while the commander is away
  and then maybe I can have a solo snake and one expansion army by turn 3.

**** Year 1 - Late Spring
The Earth Snake succeeds, while my human troops die.  The cave I invaded had an army
of Zotz in it.  They are quite weak, but strong enough to swarm my human warriors and
kill half of them and the human commander before they ran off.

[[./turn2-losses.png]]

Surprisingly, I am surrounded by unique indie troops.  There's Zotz, Lavaborn, Amazons,
plus more common Wolf Tribe and Barbarians.  This province "The Hole" has a summonable
death mage, the Camazotz.

[[./camazotz.png]]

The exciting thing about this is the combination of flying, stealth, and magic on this
unit.  Also it can lead 40 troops.  I'm thinking this will be a great asset in this MP
game.  With the right magic, perhaps a few of these leading the stealthy Zotz from the
same province could make a suprise attack against weak PD, or a Fort or Palisades.

Unfortunately right now, I'd prefer having taken a human province so I could recruit
a cheap commander for my armies.  I want to keep recruiting mages in my capitol.
Zuzu the Earth Serpent heads for the Wolf Tribe with the rest of the starting archers.
I had an Earth Mother ripped apart by Wolf Tribe testing pretender builds for this game.
The Earth Serpent's protection is much, much, higher so I think he'll be alright.

**** Year 1 - Early Summer
[[./turn3-losses.png]]

Once again, I lose half of my forces, this time its my Archers which I was hoping to build
up into a mass at some point.  Oh well.  Instead, I am recruiting the flying lancer units.
It seems like one of Nazca's strategies is to hit as hard as possible on the first turn.
The pre-emptive strike of a large mass of lance hits could knock down the total HP of a
squad so hard, they'll begin routing immediately.  This allows them to be killed off much
more easily.  If the lancers take a few casualties and their squat routes, hopefully its
no big deal.  They will fly away, and my guarded mages can blast away with fireballs and
lightning bolts or sit behind a horde of skeletons to finish the job.  The idea with a
lancer army though is to only go up against smaller armies, hit big, hit hard, and route
them.  I hope to have commanders lead lancer squads that can break away, kill PD and hit
the enemy economy hard all in one turn.  Stay on the move, converge on obvious targets,
and provide seige support when needed.

I need to figure out the other type of army I want to lead, probably mages with sun guards
and summons.  We'll get back to this.

***** Going for the Amazons
My immediate inclination is to circle Zuzu around the capitol to capture the Amazon
province.  Then I'll need a lab and temple there to begin hiring the astral mages.
With this in mind, I think I will go for the Earthquake strategy and the Earth/Death
mages, the Coya and Hurin Priest.
