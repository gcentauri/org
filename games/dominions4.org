** MA Nazca - January 2018
*** TODO Prelude
**** Pretender
  I have decided to go with an awake Earth Snake with level 6 earth magic.
  While I really wanted to take a dormant "rainbow" to fill out magic paths and
  provide minor blesses to my many sacred mages, I just had too much trouble 
  expanding with Nazca's troops.  I could carve out a decent little stronghold,
  but against the AI, I ended up starting to run low on gold and needing to expand
  more.  I started one war and then quickly was attacked by two other neighbors
  that ended my game.

  The [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]]6 Earth Snake is one of the easiest pretenders to use for expansion.  Having
  earth 6 gives extra protection (a side benefit of earth magic paths) and reinvigoration
  to the all sacred troops (great_for_mages_and_armored_troops_like_Nazca's!).  This
  snake should be able to scare off indie troops on its own (it has Fear too!) and allow
  for a much quicker expansion in the first year.  Nazca needs lots of gold to support
  the mummified elders, and taking territory will be the best way to ensure that.

  This pretender will really play its biggest role in that first year, but thankfully
  it is cheap enough that it can provide decent scales to boost our gold and magic 
  ability.  I took Growth, Luck, and Magic 3 to accomplish that.  I hear Luck + Magic 
  synergize well with the events that will occur.  A little Turmoil won't hurt, and will
  increase the amount events slightly.  Sloth 2 because none of my troops require many
  resources (we'll talk about them next), and Cold 1 is default for Nazca.  Perhaps I
  should have taken even more Cold, one of my opponents is Abysia.  The reason I didn't
  was simply that there wasn't anything great to spend the points on.  
**** Units
  Our troops are mostly weak, our strength will come from the mobility of flying,
  and our mages.  We have a variety of weapons to deal with the troop types of our
  enemies.  Spears and lances against heavy armor (or maces if they lack helmets!)
  swords, axes and missles against chaff.  I suppose our maces could help against
  undead nations as well.  We also have decent archers that can back up a skeleton
  army or have flaming arrows, etc etc.  We will have to be quick and smart.  Harrassing
  the enemy and trying to force a battle on our own terms.
**** Research Plan
  Nazca's mages are quite powerful.  Coyas will be able to wear Earth Boots and reliably
  cast E4 spells with gems, and potentially without on the chance I get an E3 Coya.
  Incas are F2A2H3 and can potentially assist chaff with morale spells, archers with
  Flaming Arrows and Wind Guide, or just Evoke away and blast folks with fireballs 
  and lightning bolts.  Coyas can also summon skelespam.  If I find indie astral mages,
  then I will probably try to invest in Coya magic and try some communions as well.

  This will be a short game I'm guessing, so I should aim for spells that will be
  powerful in the midgame.

***** Earthquake - Evocation 5
  Not many of our rivals have flying units.  I think with the game settings I may be
  able to aim for using this spell to create a decisive situation allowing throne 
  captures to win.  What else will I get from Evocation?  Fireballs and lightning for
  my mages, perhaps 

***** Flaming Arrows - Enchantment 4
  Depending on our neighbors, this could be a good target.  Skeletons are also in this
  tree so we should do some good scouting to see if Enchantment is a good school.

**** Rival Pretender Nations
***** Abysia
***** Pangaea
***** Vanarus
***** Bandar Log
***** Pythium
*** Year 1 - Spring
   [[./Turn1.png]]

  I am pleased with my start position.  For now I have limited access to capitol,
  and I should probably be able to keep the mountain passes closed from the East.

  I decided to send my inital army along with Zuzu because they can't do anything
  themselves anyway, and maybe it will prevent disaster.  I don't think Zuzu would
  get killed, but I've had occasional bad luck with Awake Expanders that end up 
  getting killed by hordes of wolf tribe or barbarians.  I'll recruit two turns
  worth of human spearmen and maybe some more archers while the commander is away
  and then maybe I can have a solo snake and one expansion army by turn 3.

** TODO unicode or some kind of link for displaying the dominions icons
  [[./dom4-icons/Path_F.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_A.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_W.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_D.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_N.png]] [[./dom4-icons/Path_B.png]]

  it would be cool to have [[./dom4-icons/Path_E.png]]6 instead of E6 for magic somehow.
  some kind of unicode support or something?  If i'm thinking about publishing with this,
  i just have to ensure that it displays in a reasonable way.  For now i suppose I can
  copy and paste from these and view it in emacs.
