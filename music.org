...............making me feel so lonely
even when you're with me
and when my friends ask me
why do you look so sad
I have to tell them
because my boyfriend is always smoking
cuz my boyfriend is always smoking weed

Oh whoa whoa Little Darlin

trying not to feel so lonely
but you could hold my hand
and when my friends ask me
why do you look so sad
I have to tell them
because my boyfriend is always smoking
cuz my boyfriend is always smoking weed

On The Beach

Are you going to the beach
You can buy suntan lotion, you can buy some treats
You can buy bermuda shorts, put them on my feet for you

Swimming, surfing, playing frisbee
We can build sand castles to the sound of the sea
You can make your mind up to go with me to the beach

M: And when we get there I’ll take you by the hand
W: It’s a churlish moment on the sand
M: The waves are crashing up against your legs
W: The summer sun can give a golden tan

We’ll stay there till the sun goes down
Then we’ll hop in El Coache and we’ll drive into town
All the people we pass wear a funny frown, yes they do.

Parked outside of your 10th street flat
I take a look in your eyes, I see you’re looking back
And I really wanna kiss you baby if you weren’t so blue

Churlin around and around this town, people really get you down
Churlin around and around this town, people really get you down

W: Shoobop Shoobop
M: There was a lover who once hurt you bad
W: (echo) There was a lover who once hurt you bad
M: Stole away all the joy you ever had
W: (echo) Stole away the joy you ever had
M: I long to tell you, you are the only one
W: (echo) I long to tell you you’re the only one

So let’s go back to the beach, and we’ll have some fun

Instruments cut out

Are you going to the beach?
All the people you love will be there to see
I can bring a guitar and sing real sweetly to you (guitar comes back in)

“Oh my baby!”
Sit by the fire as the moon goes past
We can stay up late docking till there’s dents in our ass
Finally get up the nerve to kiss you at last

On the beach
On the beach
On the beach
On the beach.

** People I Love

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I know you couldn’t understand
Why I watched your shows and gave up mine
But really you actually loved that I did that
But I hated your shows so why did I do that?

I overdid it so you didn’t have to, I guess?

I do nice things for the people I love
I do nice things for the people I love

I said you were a handsome man
“I know you think that,” is what you said.
But all of my other friends just say thank you
and sometimes they tell me that I’m lookin nice too.

I guess I thought you loved me because of all those times that you said you loved me

I say nice things to the people I love
I say nice things to the people I love

You couldn’t even live up to
the time I wolfed my teamster sub for you
it takes a devotion to do something like that
the kind of devotion that you never had

You think I’m weird? WELL…..I THINK YOU’RE WEIRD.

I do weird things for the people I love
I do weird things TO the people I love

You’re always thinking of yourself
I could really give and you could take
You’re all that you see, you think that’s true for me
You probably think that this song is about you

Spoken: “WELL IT IS!”

I’ll just be happy with the 7 other people I’m devoting my life to

I give myself to the people I love
I give myself to the people I looooooooOOOOOOVE

** That Horse
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
That Horse

Out on the Range
Good Ole’ Jerry by my side
The Sunset in our eyes
He told me he loved me, I was about to reciprocate
When I heard the most beautiful Whinny

Jerry said “Hey man, What’s up? You thinkin about them whores again?”
I said “Jerry! You can leave them whores behind, it’s that horse that’s on my mind.
That horse, I would have married that horse.”

When I was a boy just yay high to the sage brush
I saw her in the prairie
her coat was white as snow
her main was full of fire
and I knew I would love her forever

Back at school teacher caught me dreamin
and she made me speak my shame
“Teacher there are housewives, why can’t I be a horsewife? If that’s wrong I don’t want to be right.”

Teacher said, “Hey boy! Listen up! The devil himself’s gonna snatch you up.”
I said, “Teacher! You can leave your morals unsaid, it’s that horse I’m gonna wed.
That horse, I’m gonna marry that horse.”

From that day forth I’d go to see that horse
And I’d tell her my hopes and my dreams
She never said a word, but I could tell she’d heard
Cause she’d make the most beautiful whinny

Word back in town
Was they were gonna put her down
So I took that horse and ran

I said “Hey Girl! Giddyup! If you give into fear it’ll eat you up. Ride on!”
She shook her pretty head, I never took her to my bed
And I’ll never see that horse again.

No one could be blamed
That horse should not be tamed
That horse
I’m still in love with that horse

That horse
I would have married that horse.
